   // Turns out 'build.localtime' is not actually a build property - not sure where it came
   // from [from flactagger but didn't realise it needed all the plugin shirt to get it to work!! 
   // Oh the wonders of clean coding and no commenting - ensures that wheel is invented over and over again],
   // and it really should be a built-in property because stupidly the real variable, ie. build.timestamp
   // does not use the the local system time, and there is no way to make it do so!
   // So far the only workaround to obtain the real timestamp is to use yet another
   // plugin, build-helper-maven-plugin, which allows creation of a variable for the current time
   // using a hard coded timezone, which is not ideal but will have to do.
   // I thought of putting a conversion function here to get the local time from the
   // UTC timestamp, but that's no good as the displayed time would then depend on
   // the system timezone in use where the app is running.
